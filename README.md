# Gator

An RSS feed aggregator in Go.

## About

**"Gator"**, you know, because **aggreGATOR** üêä.

Anyhow, it's a CLI tool that allows users to:
- Add RSS feeds from across the internet to be collected
- Store the collected posts in a PostgreSQL database
- Follow and unfollow RSS feeds that other users have added
- View summaries of the aggregated posts in the terminal, with a link to the
full post

Gator is a multi-user CLI application. There's no server (**yet**--other than
the database!), so it's only intended for local use. But just like games in the
'90s andearly 2000s, that doesn't mean we can't have multiplayer functionality
on a single device!

## Prerequisites

You'll need to install:
- PostgreSQL
- Go

### Setup

1. Create a config file (see the [Config](#config) section for details).
2. Create a PostgreSQL database.
3. Set `db_url` in your config file:
    
    ```
    protocol://username:password@host:port/database?sslmode=disable`
    ```
    No need for SSL in local mode.

## Installation

```console
$ go install github.com/ahmadfudl/gator@latest
```

```console
$ gator
Usage: gator <command> [<args>]

```

## Usage

1. **Register a user** `gator register fudl`
2. **Add some feeds**  `gator addfeed "Articles on gingerBill" "https://www.gingerbill.org/article/index.xml"`
3. **Start aggregation** (in a separate terminal)
    `gator agg 1m`
   - `m` = minutes  
   - `h` = hours  
   - and so on...
   This updates one feed at a time with the latest posts.

4. **Browse posts from followed feeds**  
    `gator browse 2`
   Lists posts from the feeds you follow, sorted from oldest to newest.

## Config

Gator stores its configuration in a JSON file named `.gatorconfig.json`,

1. The currently logged-in user.
2. PostgreSQL database connection credentials.

```json
{
    "db_url": "postgres://example",
    "current_user_name": "username"
}
```

For a sample configuration file check: [.gatorconfig.sample.json](/.gatorconfig.sample.json)


> [!NOTE]
> There's no user-based authentication (**yet**).
> if someone has the database credentials, they can act as any user.
